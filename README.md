# Temperature Control Fan project

## tools
* Arduino Uno
* 5V Fan
* 5V Relay
* Optocoupler
* LM35 temperature sensor
* LCD
* 2N2222 NPN BJT
* LED

## How it works?
When the temperature rises to 40°C, the fan operates until the temperature drops to 30°C, and then the fan turns off.
It is not an individual work, but it was implemented by a team.
